Games Implemented
=================

Milapede
========



Space Adventure
===============



Target Practice
===============
targetPractice.py
	Modules used:
		Circle.py, user created module
		os
		random
		pygame
	Other requirements:
		target_background.png needed to display background of game
	How to play:
		Easy difficulty, a circle is sent across the screen
		when the circle reaches the target, press the spacebar.
		The user has 4 lives, when all 4 lives are expended the 
		game is over. Lives are lost by pressing the spacebar when
		the circle is not over the target


Pac Man
=======
Node.py:
	Node.py contains all necessary data members for each possible decision point
	PacMan or a ghost could turn at. I like to think it acts sort of like a railway
	that keeps them from running through walls or doing undefined behavior.

Pacman.py
	Contains the event loop that displays PacMan its self and blits the map

Needed To Run:
	Node.py
	Pacman.py

Roulette
========
- roulette wheel set-up: pockets numbered 0-36, with a 00 pocket as well

- specific order is as follows: 
	0-28-9-26-30-11-7-20-32-17-5-22-34-15-3-24-36-13-1-
	00-27-10-25-29-12-8-19-31-18-6-21-33-16-4-23-35-14-2
	
- the user will begin with $10,000 and can place bets
  (on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 numbers, with  payouts of 35 to 1, 17 to 1, 11 to 1,
  8 to 1, 6 to 1, and 5 to 1, respectively

- the user can play until they lose all of their money or until
  they decide to quit

- at the end of the game, whether they lost or won will be displayed
    - ending with more than $10,000 is a win, less than $10,000 is a loss


Blackjack
=========
- "hit" (accept another card) and "stand" (do not accept another card)
  are the only options as this is a more casual game of blackjack
  rather than one you would find in a casino

- no betting, just keeps track of wins/losses/ties
- only one opponent: the dealer
- user can continue playing rounds until they quit
- played with one deck of cards

- numeric cards (2-10) are worth their number
- face cards are worth 10
- aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever is most helpful

- if the player's hand exceeds 21, it is a loss
- elif the dealer's hand exceeds 21, it is a win
- elif the player's hand is less than the dealer's hand, it is a loss
- elif the player's hand is greater than the dealer's hand, it is a win
- else it is a tie
