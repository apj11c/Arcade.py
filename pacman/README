Node class:
	Node.py contains all necessary datamembers for each possible decision point
	PacMan or a ghost could turn at. I like to think it acts sort of like a railway
	that keeps them from running through walls or doing undefined behavior.

	-known bugs, if a user spams directions pacman could get lost and freeze the game

Pacman.py
	Contains the event loop that displays PacMan its self and blits the map

Needed To Run:
	Node.py
	Pacman.py
	PacmanBackground.png
	Pacman.png
	***all files are in the repo***
