Node class:
	Node.py contains all necessary data members for each possible decision point
	PacMan or a ghost could turn at. I like to think it acts sort of like a railway
	that keeps them from running through walls or doing undefined behavior.

Pacman.py
	Contains the event loop that displays PacMan its self and blits the map

Needed To Run:
	Node.py
	Pacman.py
	pacmanBackground.png
	pacman.png
	pacmanFood.png
	***all files are in the repo***
